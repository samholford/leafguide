			    	<h2>Generations</h2>
			    	<p>Leaf generation terminology is inconsistent across publications. Approximately one year after the Leaf was first released in 2010 (ZE0), the modified version was released that was referred to by online communities as &quot;Gen 2&quot;. This modified version has an improved battery chemistry that showed less degradation. Forum discussions prior to 2017 mostly refer to &quot;Gen 1&quot; and &quot;Gen 2&quot;.</p>
						<p>In NZ, all 2011 Leafs, and some 2012 Leafs are &quot;Gen 1&quot;. Late 2012 Leafs first (approx. Nov 2012 onwards) are &quot;Gen 2&quot;. Prior to 2019, all Leafs sold in NZ by Nissan (NZ new) were &quot;Gen 1&quot; (even the 2014 ones).</p>
						<p>You can tell &quot;Gen 1&quot; and &quot;Gen 2&quot; vehicles apart from photos of the engine bay and boot. The engine bay in the &quot;Gen 1&quot; has a smaller charger cover and the boot has a higher wall beneath the rear seats.</p>
						<p>In 2019, Nissan NZ started selling the true Second Generation Leaf (ZE1). This car looks very different externally and is priced a lot higher than earlier Leafs. It is not particularly competitive with other EVs in this price range, and more information is readily available about them.  This Leaf Guide therefore focuses on the ZE0 models and uses the &quot;Gen 1&quot; and &quot;Gen 2&quot; terminology for consistency with forum/Reddit posts relevant to these cars.</p>

			    	<h2>Imports</h2>
			    	<h5 class="red-text text-lighten-2">Ex-Japanese models</h5>
						<p>Most used Leaf imports in NZ are from Japan. The following applies to ALL ex-Japanese Leafs:</p>

	              <p>Navigation unit and instrument cluster are in Japanese and cannot be changed easily.
		              The satellite navigation (GPS) also does not function outside of Japan. However, the stereo in the &quot;Gen 2&quot; S
		              model can easily be removed and replaced with an English double din aftermarket unit. There are now some people
		              providing instrument cluster and navigation unit language conversions

						<p>Nissan NZ officially stopped selling the Nissan Leaf new in 2014 (dealers sold remaining stock into 2015). They were more expensive than imports, so dealers weren't
							interested in continuing to try to sell them. They restarted in 2019 with ZE1/new look models.

			    	<h2>Trim</h2>
			    	<p>&quot;Gen 1&quot; Leafs have two trim levels: The X (lower end) and G (higher end). Both have a charge timer
				    	(to set start and stop times for charging off peak) and climate timer (to pre-heat or pre-cool the cabin
				    	while plugged in), Bluetooth connectivity, push button start, stability control, and 6 airbags. The G adds
				    	fog lights, auto headlights, reverse camera, and a solar panel spoiler to trickle charge the accessory
				    	battery (not the main traction battery).</p>
				    <p>&quot;Gen 2&quot; introduced a third lower end trim level S, making X the mid-range. The main improvements of
					    the &quot;Gen 2&quot; Leaf are improved battery chemistry (much slower degradation), 80 kg weight reduction with aluminium
					    doors and bonnet (applicable only to Japanese models, UK models have steel doors/bonnet),
					    more boot space, hill start assist, charge plug lock + light, insulated ceiling, dark trim option, and on
					    X and G models: enhanced brake regeneration (B mode) and a more power-efficient heating system (heat pump
					    instead of resistive).</p>
					  <p>All have the same 24 kWh battery (except 2016+ models that have a larger 30 kWh option), performance, and
						  vital features such as the charge and climate timers. Note the absence of a parcel tray in all but the G
						  trim before 2016. The parking brake in the &quot;Gen 1&quot; is electronic, while it is a classical foot-operated one
						  in the &quot;Gen 2&quot; (less futuristic, but possible more reliable).</p>
						<p>The number of airbags also varies by trim. For example a 2014 S may only have driver and passenger airbags, while a G
							may have curtain airbags. It is unclear exactly which trim levels and years have different airbag specifications.</p>
					  <p>You can easily tell the S trim by the large round manual climate control knobs instead of the digital
						  climate controls of the X and G.</p>

			    	<h2>Charging</h2>
			    	<p>Charging terminology can be overwhelming, so don't get lost in the detail. Your Leaf will come with a
				    	Level 1 charger that plugs into a standard wall outlet (6 to 10 amps) or a Level 2 charger that plugs
				    	into a larger caravan plug outlet (15 amps).
				    	Using a standard wall outlet, you will be able to fully recharge overnight. A caravan plug outlet can be
				    	installed in your home by an electrician for approximately $400 - $600 and will allow a near doubling in
				    	charge speed.</p>
				    <p>Note that technically the ‘charger' is actually an EVSE (electric vehicle supply equipment) as the actual
					    charger is built into the car. A portable EVSE is plugged either into a standard wall socket or caravan plug.
					    An original Nissan EVSE (15A) from Japan cannot be used legally in NZ (<a href="https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2020-au5440"
														      target="_blank">Gazette notice 2020</a>).</p>

			    	<h2>Special features</h2>
						<p>The Leaf has a few special features that every owner should be aware of.</p>

						<ul class="collection">
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle yellow">query_builder</i>
					      <h6>Charge timer</h6>
					      <p>All Leafs allow you to set a charge timer to take advantage of off peak power rates. If you set an end time
		              only, your Leaf will automatically start charging in time to be good to go by the specified time. If you set a
		              start time, it will start charging at that time and stop (if not already charged) by the end time. 2012 and
		              2013 &quot;Gen 2&quot; Leafs (and UK Leafs until 2016) allow you charge either to 80% or 100%, but this feature
		              was discontinued in later models so they will always charge to 100%. If you don't set a timer at all, the Leaf
		              will start charging as soon as it is plugged in. If a timer is set, you can bypass the timer at anytime by
		              pressing a dedicated button on the dash.</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle orange">query_builder</i>
					      <h6>Climate timer</h6>
					      <p>All Leafs allow you to set a target cabin temperature, that the car will try to achieve while plugged in,</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle blue">bluetooth</i>
					      <h6>Bluetooth</h6>
					      <p>All models have Bluetooth, so you can divert phone calls through the car audio system. The X and G trim can
		              also connect audio from your phone, so your music or podcast will automatically pause when you turn off the
		              car or stereo, and automatically resume when you turn the car/stereo back on.</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle green">nature</i>
					      <h6>Eco mode</h6>
					      <p>Many cars have an eco mode, but on the Leaf you can actually tell the difference when it is engaged. The car always
						      runs economically, but with eco mode on, less power is delivered in a given accelerator pedal position than when not
						      in eco mode. Eco mode helps to smooth acceleration, but will allow full acceleration when the pedal is floored.
					      </p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle cyan">loop</i>
					      <h6>B mode</h6>
					      <p>B mode introduced with the &quot;Gen 2&quot; Leaf causes regenerative breaking to occur as the accelerator pedal
						      is eased. This causes the car to brake when you apply little or no pressure to the pedal. Single pedal driving
						      is therefore possible a lot of the time, though you will usually need to use the brake pedal to come to a full
						      stop or brake more quickly. This mode trades coasting for regeneration, so is best suited where it reduces braking,
						      such as stop-start traffic rather than on open roads. Having said that, you can still coast by applying just a
						      little pressure to the accelerator pedal. B mode can be enabled in addition to Eco mode.
					      </p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle blue-grey">videocam</i>
					      <h6>360 surround camera system</h6>
					      <p>G models offer the option of a 360 degree view parking camera system that gives you a birds eye view when parking.
						      It can be useful for avoiding curbed wheels and for assessing parallel parking space sizes.</p>

					<div class="section scrollspy" id="nav-battery">
			    	<h2>Battery health</h2>
						<p>All batteries degrade, but the odd one degrades faster than the rest. EV batteries from roughly 2015 onwards have been
							lasting a lot longer than earlier models. The lack of active cooling in the Leaf probably contributes, but even in temperate NZ,
							degradation can occur inexplicably quickly. As the battery degrades, the car may no longer
						be suitable for your daily communte, and the car may then have little-to-no value. <strong>There is no reliable way to replace the battery pack in NZ.</strong></p>

						<p>When purchasing a Leaf, you should check battery bars on the dashboard display. On the far right of the battery
							state of charge meter is a row of 12 bars with the numeral 1 at the top and the numeral 0 at the bottom.
							The lowest two bars will be red. </p>

						<div class="row">
			        <div class="col s12 m6">
								<img class="responsive-img z-depth-1" src="img/bars-12.jpg">
								Full 12 bars
			        </div>
							<div class="col s12 m6">
								<img class="responsive-img z-depth-1" src="img/bars-11.jpg">
								Only 11 bars
			        </div>
						</div>

						<p>The more bars the better. 8 bars or fewer signifies a massively degraded battery. I now have 6 bars 40 km will drop my battery from 80% to 20%.</p>

						<div class="spacer"></div>

			    </div>
					<div class="divider"></div><!-- End battery -->

					<div class="section scrollspy" id="nav-leafspy">
			    	<h2>LeafSpy</h2>
						<p>LeafSpy is an app available on iOS, Android and Kindle that can be used in conjunction with a wireless
							OBD2 adapter. It can be used to check the battery health, set the auto door locking behavior, log battery
							use, and reset some warnings.</p>
						<p>LeafSpy exposes a bunch of battery metrics, but does not provide interpretation. The more you read online,
							the more confusing it can become. There is a lot of debate on what certain metrics mean, so you have to
							decide for yourself. What also makes things difficult is that the numbers such as State of Health and voltage
							difference can change drastically depending on how discharged the battery is.</p>
						<p>I personally believe it is fine to purchase a Leaf without using LeafSpy, but others swear by it. To be
							thorough, you need to fully charge the Leaf, then drive it down to empty with LeafSpy running. This usually
							isn't practical for a car you don't own yet!</p>
						<p>The most official definitions of the LeafSpy metrics are available at http://www.electricvehiclewiki.com/Leaf_Spy_Pro</p>

					  <h5>LeafSpy metrics</h5>
					  <ul class="collection">
					    <li class="collection-item">
					      <h6>GID</h6>
					      <p>Non-percentage metric of battery capacity remaining. The higher this number when fully charged,
						      the larger the usable capacity of the battery.</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item">
					      <h6>State of Charge (SOC)</h6>
					      <p>Charge percentage of full (not important for gauging battery health).</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item">
					      <h6>State of Health (SOH)</h6>
					      <p>A magical number reported by the Leaf onboard computer. The higher the better (more usable fraction of
						      battery capacity). It can change by a few points at different states of charge. A Leaf with 12 bars, will
						      have a SOH of at least 85%, and each bar lost after that represents a 6.5% drop in SOH. A Leaf that is a few
						      years old and still has 12 bars, has demonstrated that it does not suffer from early degradation. However you
						      cannot make the same assessment for a newer Leaf without LeafSpy. You'll note the math doesn't quite add up and
						      is based on comparisons with the Leaf Spy SOH and the bars displayed.</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item">
					      <h6>Hx</h6>
					      <p>Another magical number that is inversely related to the battery internal resistance. It is sometimes
						      higher than 100%. The lower it goes, the more internal resistance (a marker of battery degradation).
						      Like the other numbers, don't put too much weight on this, but feel free to use it to try to bargain
						      down the price.</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item">
					      <h6>Voltage difference (shown at the bottom of the battery cells histogram)</h6>
					      <p>As the charge is depleted, the cells voltages become more unbalanced and the voltage difference goes up.
						      A massive voltage difference &lt;100 to 1000 mV might suggest a bad cell. However, the Leaf can balance the
						      cells when left plugged in, so this difference may improve if the Leaf has been sitting unused for a long
						      time, or is usually only fast charged. Again, I wouldn't worry too much about this number. I'd be very happy
						      if it is &lt;100 mV, and would maybe keep looking if a single cell's voltage was very low. It's hard to say
						      if this would have a real world impact on your range though</p>

					<div class="section scrollspy" id="nav-ownership">
			    	<h2>Ownership costs</h2>
						<p>From July 2017, the ACC component of annual registration was reduced from $86.50 to just $18! This made the annual total rego fee $76.92 in 2018.
						This was short lived, and changed to $109.16 in 2019 and has remained the same price to 2021.</p>
						<p>Depending on your electricity price, a Leaf is roughly 3 to 5 times cheaper to run per kilometre than
							a comparable ICE (internal combustion engine) / FART (foul air road terrorist) car. You should expect approx.
							6 - 7 km/kWh, so you can calculate your expected cost/km compared to your existing car.</p>
						<p>There is no annual maintenance required, no oil changes, spark plugs, or cam belts. You will need to change
							tires occasionally, and brakes every so often. But the brake pads will generally last much longer because the
							regenerative braking reducing the use of the brake pads.</p>
						<p>Personally, I went from a Subaru Forester costing $11/day for a 68 km commute + $1600 annually in maintenance
							for a $1.50/day commute with no annual maintenance. My Leaf could pay for itself in 10 years, if only the battery would last that long!</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, road user charges will one day be applied to EVs.</p>

					<div class="section scrollspy" id="nav-range">
			    	<h2>Range</h2>
						<p>The main determinants of range applicable to NZ are:</p>
						<ul class="collection">
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle yellow">battery_charging_full</i>
					      <h6>Battery state of charge (charge percentage)</h6>
					      <p>If you start with 100% charge, you will have more range than if you start with 80%.</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle blue">battery_std</i>
					      <h6>Battery capacity and age</h6>
					      <p>Obviously the larger the battery (30 kWh vs 24 kWh), the more potential range. Over years,
						      the battery capacity will degrade. A &quot;Gen 1&quot; Leaf will probably not achieve 50 km in 2022.
						      A &quot;Gen 2&quot; with 10 or more bars should get at least 100 km. You should expect more, but these minimums
						      should be kept in mind for your usual use if you are unable to test out your commute before buying.</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle orange">beach_access</i>
					      <h6>Wind and road resistance</h6>
					      <p>Wind resistance increases with speed, so the Leaf's efficiency peaks between roughly 30 kph
						      and 80 kph. Heavy traffic is a Leaf's best friend – I use about 30% less capacity crawling at
						      30 kph in rush hour compared to the same distance at 100 kph. Heavy oncoming wind will reduce
						      range, while a tailwind, or drafting behind a leading vehicle will increase range. Also rough/grippy
						      rural roads provide more rolling resistance than smooth roads, reducing range.</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle green">landscape</i>
					      <h6>Hills</h6>
					      <p>Driving up hills uses the most power, so if you go up and down a lot of hills, expect your
						      range to be less than that of a flat highway commuter. Having said that, EVs work fine
						      in Wellington, and you can regenerate a lot of the energy (perhaps 80-90% by some reports)
						      on the downhills.</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle red">perm_identity</i>
					      <h6>Driving style</h6>
					      <p>If you accelerate smoothly and decelerate over a long distance to maximise regenerative braking,
						      you will achieve more range than accelerating aggressively and braking a lot.</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle grey">beach_access</i>
					      <h6>Wet weather</h6>
					      <p>Wet roads increase rolling resistance, reducing range. Wet weather also necessitates use of the wipers,
						      which are fairly power-hungry, as well as the head lights. Where AC is also needed to defog the windshield,
						      power use increases also.
					      </p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="collection-item avatar">
					      <i class="material-icons circle blue lighten-4">wb_sunny</i>
					      <h6>Temperature</h6>
					      <p>The battery is less efficient in extremes of hot and cold. In NZ, heat does not seem to be such a problem
						      (compared to Arizona for example), but during winter, expect a 5-10% drop in range in addition to use of heating.

				      <input type="checkbox" id="cb4" />
				      <label for="cb4" class="black-text">Assess degree of rust on top of the front suspension struts. These are located under
				      covers at the rear corners of the engine bay. Most Leafs have some superficial rust, which is acceptable,
				      but look out for corrosion of the surrounding body work or loss of the screw threads indicating excessive rust.</label>
